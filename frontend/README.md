**Visual Style:**
- **Colors:** Light background (off-white or light grey), accented by primary colors like purple or blue for actionable items.
- **Cards/Widgets:** Cards should have light shadows with rounded corners and be interactive (hover effects).
- **Charts and Graphs:** Use line graphs for tracking progress (e.g., snippets saved over time), pie charts for category distribution, and bar charts for user activity statistics.
